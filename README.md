## Azure Functions for Rust

Azure Functions for Rust is a project that enables authoring functions in Rust that can be easily deployed
to [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/).

The project is currently under heavy development as it marches towards a 1.0.0 stable release.

As the project matures, this site will be updated with the (hopefully) simple instructions on how to install and use Azure Functions for Rust using Rust's package manager `cargo`.

Until that time, check out the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/peterhuene/azure-functions-rs) for more information.
